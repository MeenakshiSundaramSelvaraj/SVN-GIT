SVN and GIT

Work flow different as follows : 

An SVN workflow looks like this:
The trunk directory represents the latest stable release of a project.
Active feature work is developed within subdirectories under branches.
When a feature is finished, the feature directory is merged into trunk and removed.

A Git workflow looks like this:
The latest stable release is contained within the master branch.
Active feature work is developed in separate branches.
When a feature is finished, the feature branch is merged into master and deleted.

SVN is configured to assume that the history of a project never changes. Git allows you to modify previous commits and changes using tools like git rebase.
